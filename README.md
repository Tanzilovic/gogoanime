But a script that lets\* you watch anime via the command line written in Go.

# Why Go?

A couple of weeks ago I gave myself a challenge. I wanted to see if i could learn Go in a timespan of about 2 weeks. I did this to prove to myself that i can do anything i want to if i put my mind to it.
And this was the outcome. I will be working on this over the next couple of weeks to see if i can work through some of it's _quirks_, but so far so good :)

# Requirements

- [golang](https://go.dev)
- [mpv](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mpv)
